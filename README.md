Flu Vaccine Uptake using Machine Learning

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood that individuals will receive the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines using machine learning techniques. This prediction involves determining two separate probabilities: one for the xyz vaccine and one for the seasonal flu vaccine. The project is structured as a multilabel problem, where each target variable (xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine) is binary, indicating whether or not the respondent received the respective vaccine.

Dataset
The dataset provided contains 36 columns. The first column, respondent_id, is a unique identifier for each respondent. The remaining 35 features include a mix of binary, categorical, and ordinal variables related to demographic information, health behaviors, opinions on vaccine effectiveness and risks, and recommendations from healthcare providers. Key features include:

Demographic information: age group, sex, education, race, income level, marital status, employment status, geographic location.
Health-related behaviors: antiviral medication use, face mask purchases, hand washing frequency, attendance at large gatherings, contact with household members, health worker status, and health insurance coverage.
Opinions on vaccines: perceived effectiveness of the xyz and seasonal vaccines, concerns about the xyz flu, knowledge about the xyz flu, risk perception of getting the flu without vaccination, and worry about getting sick from the vaccine.
Healthcare provider recommendations: whether a doctor recommended the xyz or seasonal flu vaccine.
Household context: number of adults and children in the household, and presence of children under six months.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values by forward filling.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Standardize numerical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize distributions and relationships between features and target variables.
Identify correlations to understand feature importance.

Model Development:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Use a machine learning model suitable for multilabel classification, such as a RandomForestClassifier within a MultiOutputClassifier framework.
Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using the ROC AUC score for both target variables.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model.

Prediction and Submission:
Generate probability predictions for both target variables.
Prepare a submission file in the required format, including respondent_id, xyz_vaccine probability, and seasonal_vaccine probability.

Outcome
The project aims to produce a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. The performance of the model is measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) for each target variable, with the overall score being the mean of these two scores. A higher ROC AUC score indicates stronger predictive performance, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing vaccine uptake.

By effectively predicting vaccine uptake, this project can inform public health strategies to increase vaccination rates, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes and reduced flu transmission in the population.
